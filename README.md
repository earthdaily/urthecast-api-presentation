# Live demo presentation of the Urthecast API

This presentation is a live and interactive demo of the Urthecast APIs. You'll be prompted for your API key / secret early on in the presentation. All subsequent examples make live API requests and show the returned data within the slides. The actual API request is shown as an educational guide.

This demo is powered by RevealJS.

Please check out the source code for details on how everything is implemented.
